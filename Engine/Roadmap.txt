Database: only load data of nodes that are controlled by Control Server -- connected to node X, only customer Y and gateway Z can use that, so only load their data

- CHECK MAXCALL
>>> maxcall per Gateway? As it is the time waiting for the gateway to respond and this could vary per gateway
- job collecting data about last 5 minutes every 30 seconds
- maxcall refers to AVG and MAX and cannot be smaller then MIN



- Alten VoIP_SamS Dienst migrieren
-- Check limits and warn if reached
-- Check yate availability and warn if offline unexpectedly

- Caching of Task-Result for Customer Price Lookup (max dialcode length) -> controller_get_customer_cache
